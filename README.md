- Mediation Regression: the indirect effect of education on women wages
- Bootstrap to verify the confidence interval and significant level. 
# Key Conclusion
- Women wages differ significantly from men in tech industry
- Using mediation regression, we see in 1980-2010, though receiving education, women cannot earn as much as men; but in 2017-2019, receiving more education enables women earn more, just as men did.
